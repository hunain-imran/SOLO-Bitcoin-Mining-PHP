# PHP Bitcoin Mining Script

Welcome to the PHP Bitcoin Mining Script repository! This script is designed for educational purposes to understand how crypto mining works. It's built to mine Bitcoin using solo.ckpool.org:3333 and can provide a maximum hashing rate of 150khz/sec on Intel CPUs.

## What is solo.ckpool.org:3333?

solo.ckpool.org:3333 is a mining pool where miners can connect their mining hardware to collectively mine Bitcoin. Unlike traditional mining pools where miners share their rewards based on their contributed hash power, solo mining involves the miner attempting to mine blocks independently. The rewards, if successful, are then solely owned by the miner.

## Features

- *150khz/sec Hash Rate*: This script provides a hashing rate of up to 150khz/sec on Intel CPUs, allowing for efficient mining operations.
- *Educational Purpose*: The primary goal of this script is to educate users on how crypto mining functions and to provide hands-on experience in coding a mining algorithm.
- *Lottery Ticket*: While this script can theoretically mine Bitcoin, its effectiveness depends heavily on luck due to the vast computational power required to mine a block. Think of it as holding an old lottery ticket â€“ there's a chance of striking gold, but it's not guaranteed.

## Getting Started

1. *Clone the Repository*: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. *Configure*: Open the script and configure any necessary parameters, such as your mining pool credentials.
3. *Run the Script*: Execute the script on your local machine to start mining Bitcoin.
4. *Monitoring*: Keep an eye on the mining progress and adjust parameters as necessary.

## Stopping Execution

To stop hashing execution, simply delete the h.txt file from the directory where this script is located.

## Computation of Block Hash

In Bitcoin mining, the block hash is computed by concatenating and hashing various components of the block header. These components include:

- *Version*: The version field, which denotes the version of the block structure being used.
- *Previous Block Hash*: The hash of the previous block in the blockchain, which links blocks together.
- *Merkle Root*: The hash of all the transactions included in the block, ensuring transaction integrity.
- *Timestamp*: The time when the block was mined, maintaining chronological order.
- *Difficulty Target*: The threshold set by the network that the block hash must be below for the block to be considered valid.
- *Nonce*: A value that miners adjust in their mining process to find a valid block hash.

Once these components are concatenated in a specific order, they form the block header. This block header is then hashed using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm twice to produce the block hash.

The process can be summarized as follows:

1. Concatenate the version, previous block hash, Merkle root, timestamp, difficulty target, and nonce to form the block header.
2. Hash the block header using the SHA-256 algorithm.
3. Hash the resulting hash again using SHA-256 to obtain the final block hash.

Miners aim to find a block hash that meets the difficulty target by adjusting the nonce value and repeatedly hashing the block header. This process requires significant computational power and is the basis of the proof-of-work consensus mechanism in Bitcoin.
